            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I have a diverse professional background, having worked in roles such as sales manager, delivery driver, and asphalt paver. However, my true passion lies in programming. Over the past few years, I have become increasingly fascinated by web development, and I am now studying Frontend Development at Yrkeshögskolan in Borås. I enjoy solving problems through coding and love the creative challenge of building interactive, user-friendly websites. With a strong drive to learn and grow, I am excited to continue my journey in the tech world and contribute to meaningful projects. When I’m not programming, I enjoy spending time with family and friends or exploring new places.</p>
